# Computer Programming I Final Exam
## Ground rules
- no talking of any kind
- no calculator
- no internet usage(except for forking cloning, pushing, and checking work)
- only work submitted during the final exam will be accepted
- you may look at code stored in your ubuntu account




### Problem 1
	Write a function that tells you if a number is a perfect square
	return True when the variable number is a perfect square
	return False when the variable called number is not a perfect square
	e.g. 
>		number=16 -> True 
>		number =15 -> False

### Problem 2
	A factorion is a number that is equal to the sum of its factorials.
	so for example, n= 145 is a factorion. 
>	1! = 1
>	4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
>	5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
>	1 + 24 + 120 = 145

	Write a function that returns True if n is a factorion


### Extra Credit
	A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer,
	replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
	and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
	or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

	Write a function that tells you if n is a happy number
